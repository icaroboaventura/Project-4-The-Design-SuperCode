          <h2>Every idea üí° starts with a need</h2>
          <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
          </p>

              <p>
                You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
                effective ways of achieving goals.

              <p>
                By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas
                will be fresher and more valuable.

              <h3>Design solutions with love</h3>
              <p>
                Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand
                the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

              <p>
                As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not
                finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept
                feedback and learn from it.

              It has to be a problem that‚Äôs personally affecting or affected

              It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
              problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook
              and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.
